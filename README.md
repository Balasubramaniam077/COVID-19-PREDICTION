# COVID-19-PREDICTION

In 2020 I studies in Collage at UG Level. In that time Me & My friends are long for summer holidays.When the Covid-19 started to Spreading in China.Indian Government announce the Complete lockdown to all over India.At the very First time we are enjoyed to leave the collage for tha holidays.After One month later i observe the series of Covid-19 virus.A few Days later My collage started the online Classes it feeled me lazy and played a lot of online games.IN few days it makes me  very bored ðŸ¤¯.At the time i start studing the Machine learning & Deep learning.

I Think the problem statement for covid-19 affected or not to the peoples.In all Country Government are Focusing on treatment. I think that if the Covid-19 Test result given with in small period of time.It played a major role in Spearding the covid-19 Virus.I had one habit to read the Some techinical articles.I specific to see one artical there are detecting the covid-19 Using the X-Ray images & CT Scan images. At the time i think which the Machine learning & Deep Learning Model to Classification of the Covid-19 and Nornal Images 

# In this Github Repo I tried the Some machine learning Algorithms to predict the Covid-19 or Normal By using the X-Rays
