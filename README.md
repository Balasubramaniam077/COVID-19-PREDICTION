# COVID-19-PREDICTION

In 2020 I studies in Collage at UG Level. In that time Me & My friends are long for summer holidays.When the Covid-19 started to Spreading in China.Indian Government announce the Complete lockdown to all over India.At the very First time we are enjoyed to leave the collage for tha holidays.After One month later i observe the series of Covid-19 virus.A few Days later My collage started the online Classes it feeled me lazy and played a lot of online games.IN few days it makes me  very boredü•±.At the time i start studing the Machine learning & Deep learning.

I Think the problem statement for covid-19 affected or not to the peoples.In all Country Government are Focusing on treatment. I think that if the Covid-19 Test result given with in small period of time.It played a major role in Spearding the covid-19 Virus.I had one habit to read the Some techinical articles.I specific to see one artical there are detecting the covid-19 Using the X-Ray images & CT Scan images. At the time i think which the Machine learning & Deep Learning Model to Classification of the Covid-19 and Nornal Images 

# In this Github Repo I tried the Some machine learning Algorithms to predict the Covid-19 or Normal By using the X-Rays 

# Dataset:

In first offall i think i need to do collecting the Dates from various web Sites & Github Repo's for covid-19 X-rays.After one month  of collecting the data's of covid-19 images.I get into the Machine models to classify the Covid-19 or Normal

I Give my collected Dataset for <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BifNgdcdiQRlb0smRIuCd6vIVSh9Qaz?usp=sharing">Covid-19!</a>

I collected the datas from various sites.So that a Probability fo a dataset is Not !00% Correct.<b> I tried the Classification Method for only Studing purposes Only </b>
  
# In Classification Method:

In Machine learning we have the many tyoe of <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">imageNet Models</a>.I prefer the Four models to workout thats are 

<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet">DenseNet-121 ||</a>
<a href="https://models.roboflow.com/blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-mobilenetv2">MoblieNetV2 ||</a>
<a href="https://paperswithcode.com/model/resnet?variant=resnet-34">resnet-34 ||</a>
<a href="https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch#:~:text=EfficientNet%20PyTorch%20is%20a%20PyTorch,flexible%2C%20and%20extensible%20as%20possible.">EfficientNet ||</a>
  
In Four Classification Models are performed well but i Compare the model which gives the more accurate for Real time Purposes

</table>
 
 In above Table i consider EfficientNet-b4 is best accuracy model in Real time Testing with test images. When Compare to the Weigth file Size is Densenet121 is an Good Model.It is very easy to host in website or apply in Applications 
 
 <b>Conclusion</b>
 
 I prefer the Densenet121 Model for the real time uses. I will increase the accuracy for the model for appling the more Epochs in Training Period.It will give me the perfect accuracy I needed for this model
 
 
 <b>Future Enhancements</b>
 
 
Apologies üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I will train Densenet-121 Model for high accuracy and i updated in my Densenet-121 model folder
